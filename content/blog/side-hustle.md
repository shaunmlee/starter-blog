Reading anything regarding personal finance in 2019 will inevitably lead you to advice on starting a side hustle. Whether it's running an affiliate marketing site, starting a blog (ahem) or joining the gig economy, side hustles are seemingly the only way any of us are going to get rich.

And it's easy to see why. Who wouldn't want additional income alongside their monthly paycheck but what's not often discussed is the poor return on investment - not of cash but of time.

Starting any of the above mentioned side hustles sounds easy enough on paper but the chance of success is vanishingly small. 

Take Amazon affiliate marketing for example.  You link to Amazon products and when someone purchase that item via your link you receive a percentage commission (usually circa 5%).  Amazing! Get a few people to purchase the item you've linked (preferably something pricey like electronics) and you're quids in.

Except one thing: traffic. Getting people to actually find and use your website is remarkably difficult and something of a black art. If you don't already have an established user-base it will be very difficult to get any income from this.

And that's where the difficulty really lies. As incomes from side-hustles tend to be on the lower end of the scale the requirement to build up an establised website, blog, or profile on a gig site such as Fiverr your return on invested time may be small or more than likely, nil.

So what's the alternative? Firstly, it can be a blessing in disguise. By critically looking at what you can expect back from your time it makes you appreciate what else you could be spending that time doing. Exercise, time in nature, home cooking, socialising with friends and family are all invaluable when you regularly have the 9-5 grind. Investing what time you have outside of that into effectively a second low-paying job really just isn't worth it.

Now you're probably thinking 'Hang on, it's all well and good you preaching such lessons but surely you're already comfortable'. To a degree, yes. I have the goal of financial independence and hopefully retiring early (a.k.a. FIRE) so any additional income would help my investment goals to reach that.

I also write with experience on the affiliate marketing example above so understand it's temptation.

So what's the answer? Well, boring if I'm honest. The old adage of 'a penny saved is a penny earned' could not be more relevant in the times of growing personal debt. Many of us don't have an emergency fund for unexpected outgoings let alone a savings pot that could sustain us if we were to lose our job. 

Taking the advice of exercise and home-cooked meals for example could save you quite literally a fortune in terms of your health (invaluable), being ill (expensive and shit) and hundreds of pounds in restaurant bills.

Cutting down on outgoings, enjoying the time outside of work to remain physically and mentally healthy which will enable you to focus on your primary source of income is the way to really get the benifits of a side hustle.
