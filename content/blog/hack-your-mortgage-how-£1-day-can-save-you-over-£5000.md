_Overpaying even a tiny amount on your mortgage can save £1000s of interest and years of repayments._

All of us want the best returns on our money. We often seek out high interest savings accounts, only buy products when they’re on offer or scour second hand shops to find a bargain.

But there’s one area of your finances that can have an enormous return on investment, improve your credit rating and make you mortgage free years ahead of where you’d be otherwise.

# Compound interest

First, let’s understand a little thing called compound interest.

The incredible power of compound interest on your investments is well known if not well understood. As an example, earning 10% per year on an initial investment of £1,000 for 10 years doesn’t just increase its value by 100% as you might initially expect (think 10% per year x 10 years) but actually 259%. Not bad, ey?

This is because the interest you earn one year then earns interest on itself the next year and so on and so forth.

# Compound debt

Unfortunately the reverse of that is true as well: compound debt.

In the world of personal finance we’re always told to clear high-interest debts like credit cards first (which you absolutely should do!) but another culprit is low interest debts that last dozens of years i.e. your mortgage.

Over such a long time scale even low interest rates can result in massive amounts of interest accruing on your loan.

# Typical first-time buyer’s mortgage

To put this into perspective, according to Money Supermarket, the average first-time buyer mortgage is £176,693.

Given the relative increase in house prices and buyers looking to keep monthly payments low, the typical term for these mortgages is 40 years with the 25 year terms being a thing of the past.

Now the scary part. Assuming you’re able to keep the interest rate at 2% for the entire duration of the mortgage (by changing providers and taking advantage of introductory low rates) over this 40 year period you will pay over **£80,000** in interest! Remember that’s on top of the £176,693 actually borrowed (known as the principal of the loan), that will still need to be repaid.

# How £1/day can rescue you

Now comes the fun part. The interest you pay is calculated each month on the remaining principal of the loan. Every time you make a monthly payment you pay the lender interest and eat away at the principal. Over time this erodes the principal to zero hence the name mortgage which is derived from the French ‘to kill the pledge’.

When you overpay on your mortgage, this amount goes directly into eating away at the principal. This means reducing the amount of interest you’ll end up paying.

As we discussed, compound interest works both ways: great for savings, terrible for debts. What if we overpaid a small, regular amount each month to chip away at the debt faster?

Sounds like money you don’t have in your hand going into a mortgage you already spend a good chunk of your salary on.

But what about if the amount was pathetically small? Say £1/day - not even in the realms of ‘not buying that latte’ that gets bounded around.

The results? You’ve just saved **£6,964.46** in interest on that 40 year mortgage. Not only that, as the principal has been eaten away quicker you’ve also just saved yourself **3 years and 1 month** of payments! All for £1/day on something you’d otherwise still have to pay!

If you’re on a higher interest rate than 2% then the savings will be even greater. If you are currently paying over roughly 2% then definitely look into remortgaging to take advantage of lower rates as you’ll be paying a small fortune in interest you otherwise wouldn’t have to.

# Taking it further: £5/day

OK, you’re sold on overpaying on your mortgage and even tiny amounts make a huge impact. What about a figure that’s still in the realms of possibility? Say the cost of buying lunch vs. taking in something from home.

You, lucky contestant, have just saved **£25,914.17** in interest and cleared the mortgage **11 years and 11 months** early!

Think of that, an extra fiver per day will make you nearly the yearly median household income.

# Great, but I’m not a first time buyer

The beauty of overpayments is that given the long time horizons of mortgages, even if you aren’t a first-time buyer taking on a 40 year mortgage, the term on most mortgages are still in the dozens of years.

Let’s take an example of the common remortgage figure of £148,520 and assume it’s over a 20 year term.

Our example overpayments still yield incredible results.

£1/day would save you **£1,568.79** in interest and clear the mortgage **11 months** early. And £5/day would save you **£6,608.82** in interest and clear it **3 years and 11 months** early.

# Wrapping it up

Overpaying on a mortgage is one of the easiest, lowest risk and highest reward ways to make your money work for you.

The beauty also lies in the fact you’re not committed to doing it. If one month things are tighter than normal, you don’t have to overpay anything. If, on the other hand, there’s a surplus at the end of the month and everything else is taken care of then larger payments make even bigger impacts.
