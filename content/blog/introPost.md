A blog in 2019, this is bound to be a success. The purpose of it is not however for creating an AdSense jumble of articles but instead a way to flesh out ideas in writing for later reference and maybe even third party reading.

Ideas to come in no order with no guarantee there'll ever be create:
1. Maybe the USSR is the reason we had 45 years of peace with the West having something to prove.
2. Exloring Naval's post on leverage and building wealth.
3. Icy worlds and the increased chance of life's survival vs. living on the surface of a planet.
4. Thoughts on FIRE and overpaying a mortgage alongside.

The list above will be updated I'm sure as more ideas come and potentially disappear.
